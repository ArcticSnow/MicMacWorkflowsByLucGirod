# MicMacWorkflowsByLucGirod

This repository includes workflows for MicMac (and usually a bit of GDAL at the end), created by Luc Girod.

This repository is a work in progress as I try to provide the most automated and fool-proof scripts, not only my dirty ones that need tempering for each dataset ;)

The MicMac wiki can also help you : http://micmac.ensg.eu

The community is on Reddit : https://www.reddit.com/r/MicMac/
The forum is always open : http://forum-micmac.forumprod.com/
