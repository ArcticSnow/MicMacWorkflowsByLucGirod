The DevAllPrep script
=====================

Sometimes, computers have CPUs so fast that the storage systems can't keep up. MicMac uses a relativelly old way to distribute load in all available CPUs (though make files), that tends to crash when converting images into tif. This script creates a script that does the convertion on a single core. Slow but steady.

Note that this script is called automatically by other scripts.
